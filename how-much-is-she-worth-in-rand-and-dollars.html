With this, the</strong><strong> South African multi-skilled celebrity is noted to be</strong><strong>&nbsp;one of the richest celebrities in South Africa.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bonang Matheba’s net worth is huge due to the many things she does, including being a television presenter, radio personality, businesswoman, producer, and model. She is known for perfecting her skills, especially her presenting skills, which helped her become famous.</p><h2><b>Bonang Matheba’s Net Worth is R100 Million or $7 Million</b></h2><p>The industrious celebrity has at least six income sources contributing to her net worth. The 37-year-old <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bonang Matheba</a> was born into a family of industrious people, which explains why she is hardworking. She started making moves towards her career as a teenager, and so far, she has made a name for herself in South Africa and beyond.</p><h3><b>As a TV Host, Bonang Made Her First Screen Appearance at the Age of 15</b></h3><p>Bonang Matheba A.K.A Queen B was only fifteen years old when she featured in a TV show for the first time. She made her debut with the SABC 2 kids show, Manhattan Fantasy Challenge. She appeared in many other SABC 2 kids’ shows after that.</p><p>Upon graduating from the university in 2007, the celebrity auditioned for the first season of the SABC 1 music show, “Live Amp,” which was known as “LIVE” at the time. Eventually, she won the show and had the honor of co-hosting alongside Tbo Touch.</p><p>During her time on the show, Bonang showed off her exceptional hosting skills, which led to the birth of her nickname “Queen B.” On the 31st of August 2012, she did her last episode on the show and then announced her departure from LIVE.</p><p>After leaving the show, she went on to host many other shows, including Clash of the Choirs SA, Afternoon Express, Top Billing, and KFC Taste Kitchen.&nbsp;There is no question that Matheba is an established and talented presenter/host, as she has hosted several events and award shows. Some of which include:</p><ul><li>Pre-shows for the MTV Europe Music Awards (2014)</li><li>MTV Africa Music Awards (2016)</li><li>BET Awards (2016)</li><li>Miss South Africa (2018)</li><li>Global Citizen: Mandela 100 concert (2018)</li></ul><p>The Global Citizen: Mandela 100 concert, which took place on the 2nd of December 2018, is one of her most notable hosting gigs as she vo-hosted alongside comedian Trevor Noah, supermodel Naomi Campbell, and other notable public figures.</p><h3><b>As a Radio Presenter, Bonang Matheba Hosted “The B* Hive” for 5 Years</b></h3><p>Bonang served as a Radio Presenter at YFM radio station from 2009 to 2014. She was called and invited to join other new presenters, to which she agreed. She was then given a weekend afternoon show, “The B* Hive,” to present. The show was targeted at young listeners and was a great success at the time.</p><p>In 2015, she became a DJ for the Metro FM radio station, a position that was formerly held by Siphokazi January. Siphokazi then became the new Metro FM veteran. Bonang handled the slot show “The Front Row,” and it performed well and had dedicated listeners. The young lady left the radio station due to a lack of communication on the side of the management.</p><p>During one of their shows, an on-air reshuffle led to Bonang hosting the show alongside Lerato Kganyago. Both of them are long-time industry rivals, so this made Bonang upset, and she resigned from her job the next day.</p><h3><b>Bonang Started Her Acting Career in 2018</b></h3><p>While working on her hosting career, Queen B dabbled in acting. Her first acting role was in the SABC 1 drama, “InterSEXions,” where she played the role of Nurse Seipati. This was in 2018. In 2017, she founded her entertainment house, Bonang Matheba Entertainment. She then went on to lunch the 1Magic reality TV show, Being Bonang. The show is about her day-to-day lifestyle and activities. By 2019, she produced and starred in the documentary “Public Figure.”</p><h3><b>Matheba Has Several Clothing Lines</b></h3><p>Bonang Matheba’s net worth grew bigger thanks to her business acumen. She owned her first clothing line in 2008. She collaborated with retailer Legit and launched her “Just B” clothing line. Later, she created a handbag collection, “Baby Star,” in collaboration with a London-based designer.</p><p>Again in 2014, she launched her lingerie line “Distraction by Bonang.” She achieved this in collaboration with Woolworths, an expensive South African retail brand. In 2018, the businesswoman started a T-shirt collection in collaboration with Superbalist. The line was named “BONANG by Bonang Matheba.”</p><p>Different quotes by Matheba were printed on the T-shirt. The quotes included “#IAmBonang,” “Mo’ghel,” and “Give The People What They Want.”&nbsp;In 2019, Bonang made a groundbreaking achievement in business. She launched her luxury beverage brand called “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>The House of BNG</a>.”</p><p>The wine was loved by many in South Africa and was even used during the Miss South Africa pageant and the presidential inauguration. This made her the first black woman to be added to the Méthode Cap Classique Association. A few years later, the brand launched its Prestige Reserve MCC drink at one of the biggest horse racing events in South Africa.</p><h3><b>Influencer: She Is the First International Ambassador for Revlon Outside the US</b></h3><p>Matheba’s first known endorsement deal was with the cosmetic brand Revlon in 2013. She was announced the brand ambassador in South Africa, making her the first international ambassador for the brand outside the United States. Later in October 2016, the celebrity was made the ambassador for Cîrco in Africa. The vodka brand chose her with fashion designer David Tlale, hip hop artist Da L.E.S, and club DJ, DJ Dimplez.</p><p>In 2017, the title of the Ambassador for Ipanema sandals was taken from Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen and given to her. The South African entertainer had traveled to Brazil during that time, and she had a meeting with the Brazilian shoemakers. She equally shot an advertisement in Rio de Janeiro even before the announcement.</p><p>Again in 2018, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bonang Matheba</a> was made a brand influencer for cellular network Cell C.&nbsp; Through this deal, she launched her mobile app and an emoji pack known as “BMoji.” Later in 2018, she was endorsed as the South African ambassador for Samsung for their S20 range and the Z Flip. Other endorsement deals she has signed include; Peugeot, BIC Razors, Brutal Fruit, Diva Divine Hair, Lifestyle Pads, and Courvoisier.</p><h3><b>Bonang Matheba Released Her Autobiography in 2017</b></h3><p>Bonang has been successful in many things, but being an author has been somewhat daunting. The businesswoman released her autobiography on the 7th of June 2017. The book was titled “From A to B” and was published by Blackbird Books, a publishing house owned by Thabiso Mahlape.</p><p>Unfortunately, the public criticized the book greatly for many grammatical and factual errors. The criticism was so much that retailer, Exclusive Books had to pull the book down from the shelf. A second edition in which the errors from the first one were corrected was later released.</p><h3><b>Summary of Bonang Matheba’s Net Worth Sources</b></h3><ul><li>TV Host</li><li>Radio Presenter</li><li>Actress</li><li>Entrepreneur</li><li>Influencer</li><li>Author</li></ul><h3><b>What Is the Biggest Contributor to Bonang Matheba’s Net Worth?</b></h3><p>There is no doubt <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bonang Matheba</a> makes good money from all her income sources.
