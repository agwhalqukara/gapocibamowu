Minaj’s father was a violent drug addict with a long history. At one point, he set fire to the family’s home in a failed attempt to kill Minaj’s mother. Those early struggles, Minaj has said, helped fuel her drive to rise above the life her parents knew. “I’ve always had this female-empowerment thing in the back of my mind,” she told Details magazine, “because I wanted my mother to be stronger, and she couldn’t be. I thought, ‘If I’m successful, I can change her life.'”</p><p>To reach that point, the young Minaj developed personas for herself that would allow her to reinvent herself. An early incarnation was “Cookie,” then came “Harajuku Barbie” before finally settling on Nicki Minaj. “Fantasy was my reality,” she has said.
