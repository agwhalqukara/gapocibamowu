The pair met in 2012 — when Swift was 22 and Styles was 18 — and dated for few months. Despite their short-lived romance — and sans&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>tattoo keepsakes</a>&nbsp;— their romance was also fruitful, inspiring songs penned by both Grammy-winning musicians.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the tone of her Styles-inspired tracks wasn't exactly apologetic (as was the case when Swift wrote "Back to December" about&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ex Taylor Lautner</a>), fans knew they were&nbsp;never, ever, ever, getting back together. However,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the internet's favorite "divorced parents"</a>&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;shake it off&nbsp;and maintain a healthy and supportive relationship post-breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2023, a source confirmed the two have remained "friendly."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Taylor and Harry have no issues, and they are friendly," the source&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Entertainment Tonight</a>.

He&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told&nbsp;The Mirror</a>&nbsp;shortly after the award show that he knows "one of the biggest artists in the world thinks Harry is so hot."

Swift was in a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>relationship with Conor Kennedy</a>&nbsp;that summer, and Styles had a short-lived fling with English actress Emily Atack around the same time. The two finally got together in the fall and subtly confirmed their coupledom when Swift was spotted&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>wearing a silver paper plane necklace</a>&nbsp;that appeared to belong to Styles,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>according to BuzzFeed</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before Thanksgiving,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People&nbsp;reported</a>&nbsp;that Styles had swung by&nbsp;The X Factor&nbsp;studio to see Swift rehearse.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was smiling at her while she rehearsed.

Apart from the trip being a romantic and celebratory getaway, it appeared to be an introductory meeting, with Styles introducing his then-girlfriend to his mom.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-31-2012-taylor-swift-and-harry-styles-spend-the-holidays-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 31, 2012: Taylor Swift and Harry Styles spend the holidays together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Styles and Swift's whirlwind romance was in full force in December. Before Christmas, the musicians headed to a wintry wonderland, specifically Park City, Utah, for a skiing trip. Then they rang in the New Year together with a midnight kiss in Times Square following Swift's performance on&nbsp;Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>per&nbsp;People</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-january-7-2013-taylor-swift-and-harry-styles-break-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>January 7, 2013: Taylor Swift and Harry Styles break up</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By early January 2013, Haylor was, sadly, no longer. After spending the holidays together in the British Virgin Islands, the two reportedly got in a fight, and Swift left the trip early — famously, alone on a boat,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;reported</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miss Americana&nbsp;never said anything at the time, but years after they split, she opened up about how turbulent their relationship really was while introducing her song "Out of the Woods" at the Grammy Museum in 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a video of the performance, Swift provided some context behind the track: "The number one feeling I felt in the whole relationship was anxiety. Because it felt very fragile, it felt very tentative. And it always felt like, 'Okay, what's the next roadblock? What's the next thing that's gonna deter this? How long do we have before this turns into just an awful mess and we break up? Is it a month? Is it three days?'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So, you know, I think a lot of relationships can be very solid, and that's kind of what you hope for, for it to be solid and healthy, but that's not always what you get," she continued before clarifying, "It doesn't mean that it's not special and extraordinary just to have a relationship that's fragile and somehow meaningful in that fragility."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not that we ever like to see a relationship end, but selfishly, in the case of Swift and Styles, at least fans got several amazing records out of the breakup. From Swift, there were three tracks from her&nbsp;1989&nbsp;album ("Out of the Woods," "Style," and "I Knew You Were Trouble") that are believed to be about Styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Styles all but admitted that his songs "Two Ghosts" and "Ever Since New York" were inspired by his relationship with Swift. Explaining his breakup with the cultural icon and the subsequent songwriting process, he told&nbsp;Rolling Stone, "Certain things don't work out. There are a lot of things that can be right, and it's still wrong. In writing songs about stuff like that, I like tipping a hat to the&nbsp;time together. You're celebrating the fact it was powerful and made you feel something, rather than 'this didn't work out, and that's bad.'"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-5-2023-taylor-swift-supports-harry-styles-at-grammy-awards></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 5, 2023: Taylor Swift supports Harry Styles at Grammy Awards</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2023 Grammy Awards, Swift was among those in the audience to show her support for Styles during his performance of the 2022 hit single, "As It Was," and when he accepted his televised awards,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to&nbsp;ET</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two also reportedly hugged and talked during Steve Lacy's performance of "Bad Habit."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9OasKWnomLAuLXFrWatmqRiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1eceaqauxXajBurjErGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Harry%20Styles%27s%20Relationship%20Timeline%3a%20A%20Look%20Back&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Harry%20Styles%27s%20Relationship%20Timeline%3a%20A%20Look%20Back" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Harry%20Styles%27s%20Relationship%20Timeline%3a%20A%20Look%20Back" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Harry%20Styles%27s%20Relationship%20Timeline%3a%20A%20Look%20Back" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-harry-styles-s-relationship-timeline-a-look-back.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Harry%20Styles%27s%20Relationship%20Timeline%3a%20A%20Look%20Back" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./unmasking-what-is-deadpan-comedy-simple-definition-type-element-feature-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unmasking What is Deadpan Comedy: Simple Definition, Type, Element, Feature And More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steve-kroschel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Kroschel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
