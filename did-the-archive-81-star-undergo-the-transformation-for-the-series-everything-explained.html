Fans have made assumptions about the 36-year-old actor's little weight gain in the series, but he has not yet spoken. Matt McGorry has changed his diet and exercise regimen because he is really worried about his health and wants to stop putting pressure on himself to look a certain way.</strong></p><p><b>Matthew David McGorry </b>mostly known as <strong>Matt</strong> <b>McGorry</b> (born April 12, 1986) is an American <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>actor</a></strong>, writer, and activist best known for his roles as Asher Millstone on the ABC legal drama series How to Get Away with Murder and John Bennett on the Netflix comedy-drama Orange Is the New Black.</p><p>Recently, Matt also made an appearance on the Netflix original supernatural horror series Archive 81, which premiered on January 14, 2022. The show is based on the 2016-launched podcast of the same name. <strong>James Wan</strong>, a well-known horror director, and producer, is the creator of the new horror program Archive 81. It centers on Dan, which is portrayed by <strong>Mamoudou Athie</strong>, who is employed to restore a number of old cassettes.</p><p>This, however, forces Matt to look into an enigmatic and dangerous cult. The show's high-stakes atmosphere is popular with viewers, who have gone to social media to express their opinions.</p><p>Following Matt's participation in the spooky horror Netflix series Archive 81, fans have been curious to learn more about Matt, particularly his struggle with weight gain. So, let's read this article to find out!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Eddie Lacy</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Lena Dunham</a></strong>.</p><h2>Matt McGorry’s Weight Gain Journey: The Archive 81 Star Has Yet to Mention If He Put on Some Pounds for the Series; A Complete Breakdown on His Supposed Transformation!</h2><p>Netflix's supernatural horror streaming television series, Archive 81, has achieved enormous success and was <a href=# rel=noopener>released</a> on January 14, 2022. The relentless suspense and startling turns have fans enamored. However, some viewers have noted that Orange Is the New Black actor <strong>Matt McGorry</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@mattmcgorry</a>) has gained a little weight since his last appearance and his weight gain is right now trending on the Internet.</p><p>The actor hasn't said anything about whether or not he put on weight for his role in Archive 81, despite the fact that many people ponder this. But in the recent past, he seemed very different.</p><p>Some have noticed that Matt McGorry has put on weight during the past few years. He did, however, publish a personal essay about his evolving relationship with diet culture and fitness in May 2020. McGorry <a href=# rel=noopener>discussed</a> his weight gain and how it affected his health. In May 2020, people saw him write,</p><p><strong>I’ve gained quite a bit of weight. I mean, I’ve really let go. And as a result, my health has been impacted.I have a healthier relationship with my body than ever before. I’velet go of internalized fatphobia, and all correlating notions that I have to look a certain way to deserve love, dignity, and respect.</strong></p><p>Matt McGorry revealed that he first struggled with his weight when he was a child when other kids made fun of him for being overweight. He started working as a personal trainer and gained muscle while shedding pounds, but it never felt like enough.</p><p>After his appearance on Orange Is The New Black, many Archive 81 viewers have observed that Matt McGorry has gained a little weight and they want to know more about his weight gain journey.</p><p>Matt McGorry had to practice for numerous shirtless sequences while working as a personal trainer during the time Orange Is The New Black was being filmed. He describes his own dehydration strategy, and how he used to restrict his meals and increase his workout time in the gym.</p><p>He experienced a decline in energy, a loss of s*x desire, and frequent frustration and melancholy, which strained his relationship with the person he was living with at the time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Due to the 36-year-old actor's waning energy, Matt McGorry found it difficult to concentrate on anything outside getting to the next meal, his obsession with food and weight loss, and his body, which he frequently checked in the mirror.</p><p>Matt pushed himself to dangerously high levels, but most people gave him the approval he needed and now he loves himself after his weight gain.</p><p>McGorry eventually came to the conclusion that his severe exercise and nutrition regimens were actually detrimental to his physical and mental health. He decided to stop putting pressure on himself to appear a specific way, and as a result, he claims to be happier and healthier. He also shares that he is worth far more than a lifetime of worrying excessively about food, exercise, and weight.</p><p><strong>I’ve gained weight since I decided to love, and heal my relationship to, my body.</strong></p><p>Although Matt McGorry has admitted that he still finds it difficult to hear negative <a href=# rel=noopener>comments</a> about his body, he is content with the person he has become and he is very happy with his weight gain.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGikmqykYrqks86rqbJlp5q2qLTTZp6aoZ5k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html&text=Did%20The%20Archive%2081%20Star%20Undergo%20The%20Transformation%20For%20The%20Series%3f%20Everything%20Explained%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html&title=Did%20The%20Archive%2081%20Star%20Undergo%20The%20Transformation%20For%20The%20Series%3f%20Everything%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html&title=Did%20The%20Archive%2081%20Star%20Undergo%20The%20Transformation%20For%20The%20Series%3f%20Everything%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html&title=Did%20The%20Archive%2081%20Star%20Undergo%20The%20Transformation%20For%20The%20Series%3f%20Everything%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-the-archive-81-star-undergo-the-transformation-for-the-series-everything-explained.html&description=Did%20The%20Archive%2081%20Star%20Undergo%20The%20Transformation%20For%20The%20Series%3f%20Everything%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./regine-velasquez-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Regine Velasquez Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./betsy-brandt-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Betsy Brandt Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
