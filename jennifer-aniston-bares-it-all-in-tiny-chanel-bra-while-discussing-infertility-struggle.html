And God forbid a woman is successful and doesn’t have a child,' she said. 'And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn’t give him a kid. It was absolute lies. I don’t have anything to hide at this point.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She then faced further scrutiny during her marriage to Justin, now 51, with reports at the time of their 2017 split suggesting that part of the reason for their break-up was her inability to have children.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In February 2018, months after their divorce was made public, <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>People</a> magazine reported that the pair had tried for children, but that 'it didn't work out', with one source saying that Jennifer was 'sad that it never happened but that it never consumed her'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking to Allure, the actress insisted that she has come to terms with the fact that she won't have children, noting that she actually feels some 'relief' in the fact that the possibility of kids is no longer lingering over her as never-ending 'maybe'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indeed, with age has come a new-found sense of confidence in herself - and the actress said she no longer cares what people think or say about her, thanks in large part to the struggles she faced during her late 30s and 40s.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I would say my late 30s, 40s, I’d gone through really hard s***, and if it wasn’t for going through that, I would’ve never become who I was meant to be,' she explained.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-e87e6d6e4c6f4737 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/09/15/64365219-11408083-_I_would_ve_given_anything_if_someone_had_said_to_me_Freeze_your-a-12_1668008204610.jpg height=769 width=962 alt="'I would¿ve given anything if someone had said to me, &#34;Freeze your eggs.

about her complicated relationship with her parents. Her father, John, and her mother, Nancy, were both actors. They divorced when she was nine, which she admitted wasn't easy for her mom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think my mom’s divorce really screwed her up,' she said.

'It’s toxic to have that resentment, that anger. I learned that by watching my mom never let go of it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I remember saying, "Thank you for showing me what never to be." So that’s what I mean about taking the darker things that happen in our lives, the not-so-happy moments, and trying to find places to honor them because of what they have given to us.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jennifer also addressed the changing landscape of Hollywood, saying she feels as though real 'movie stars' no longer exist - and suggesting that the industry doesn't have the same kind of 'fun' that it once used to, noting: 'I feel like it’s dying.
