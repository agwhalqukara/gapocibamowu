More specifically, the athlete had time to reflect on how his makeout with Jordyn, 26, affected not just Khloé, 39, but her family as well.</p><p>“If someone told me, do you think <a href=#><strong>Kylie [Jenner]</strong></a> misses Jordyn? I’d probably say yes. And I feel bad about that. Especially me being the older one,” he said. “I should have handled it differently. I should have handled it more as the older person. As the wiser [person].”</p><p>Tristan admitted that <a href=#>it took time for him to realize his mistakes</a>, adding, “Sometimes for men they don’t realize until they are 40 or 50 when the train is already gone. Hopefully, my train hasn’t left.”</p><p>The NBA player<a href=#> started dating Khloé in 2016</a>, and they announced one year later that they were expanding their family. Days before their daughter True’s arrival in 2018, Tristan <a href=#>cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend</a> with multiple women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tristan-Thompson-Calls-Out-Problematic-Power-Dynamic-in-Jordyn-Woods-Hookup.jpg><p>After<a href=#> initially staying together</a>, Khloé and Tristan called it quits in February 2019 when he kissed Kylie’s former best friend Jordyn. (Jordyn was 21 and Tristan was 28 at the time.)</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in August 2020 that Khloé and Tristan <a href=#>were giving their romance another chance</a>. Less than one year later, they split again. The pair briefly reconciled in late 2021 before ending it for good.</p><p>News broke in December 2021 that the athlete was being sued by <a href=#><strong>Maralee Nichols</strong></a> for child support. One month later, Tristan acknowledged that <a href=#>he is the father to the fitness model’s son, Theo</a>, after requesting genetic testing. It was later revealed that Khloé and Tristan’s surrogate was pregnant at the same time, giving birth to their son, Tatum, in summer 2022.</p><p>In the aftermath of Tristan’s hookup with Jordyn, Kylie, 26, <a href=#>parted ways with her then-best friend</a>.</p><p>The former friends reunited on multiple occasions earlier this summer. Before Jordyn and Kylie publicly crossed paths, Tristan <a href=#>sat down with Khloé’s youngest sister</a> to finally address the drama.</p><p>“It really bothers me because we had such a dope relationship. But everyone got affected differently. You were affected the most by the situation,” he told Kylie in Thursday’s episode. “You lost Jordyn who was a big part of your life. I know how much she meant to your life and your connection. You were two peas in a pod so the fact that I put myself into the situation wasn’t right and wasn’t smart.”</p><p>Tristan continued: “I want to say I am sorry. I feel bad about it. … The fact that I came with my poor decisions and being a f—king idiot who was young and stupid, I wanted to say I am sorry again for that.”</p><p>Kylie, who accepted the apology, said <a href=#>the situation changed her for the better.</a></p><p>“I think I was so codependent with Jordyn that I could never imagine my life without her. We would have probably still been living together. She needed to grow without me and I needed to grow without her,” she added. “Jordyn and I are cool. We still talk and catch up. We are good.”</p><p>Tristan subsequently asked Kylie to “relay” his apology to Jordyn as well before hitting the next stop on his apology tour. His trip to <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>‘s house started off a little awkward when Tristan ran into 11-year-old daughter, Penelope. (Kourtney, 44, revealed in an episode from earlier this month that her dislike for Tristan rubbed off on her daughter.)</p><p>After sitting down with Kourtney, Tristan <a href=#>attempted to explain what led to him</a> being unfaithful</p><p>“I was cheating for an action or for a feeling. But it also came down to not really knowing how to love. That’s the way I grew up,” he noted. “With therapy, I realized my childhood upbringing, I saw how my dad would treat my mom. As a kid when you see that, the trauma where you can’t protect your mom because you’re so young, you numb your emotions. It’s my defense mechanism.”</p><p>Tristan went on to share <a href=#>how therapy has allowed him</a> to address his mistakes. “I never understood how to feel pain or emotions because the most important person in my life — even if she was treated terribly — was always happy,” he continued. “I have never seen a man treat a woman good. I have never seen a man not cheat on a woman. I have never seen a good husband.”</p><p>In response, Kourtney made it clear that she was still upset with Tristan for hurting Khloé.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t think you deserve Khloé. The actions that you have done is not something she deserves,” the Poosh founder said before a “To Be Continued” message appeared at the end of the episode.</p><p>Hulu releases new episodes of The Kardashians every Thursday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2grrOwwKyfopmeqHqzscKap2asop7Ata3NZquhp52lwLC6jK2YpaOjYrewvsOypWavn6SxtHnHqKakraBk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html&text=%27The%20Kardashians%27%20Recap%3a%20Tristan%20Thompson%20Talks%20Jordyn%20Woods%20Hookup&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html&title=%27The%20Kardashians%27%20Recap%3a%20Tristan%20Thompson%20Talks%20Jordyn%20Woods%20Hookup" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html&title=%27The%20Kardashians%27%20Recap%3a%20Tristan%20Thompson%20Talks%20Jordyn%20Woods%20Hookup" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html&title=%27The%20Kardashians%27%20Recap%3a%20Tristan%20Thompson%20Talks%20Jordyn%20Woods%20Hookup" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-kardashians-recap-tristan-thompson-talks-jordyn-woods-hookup.html&description=%27The%20Kardashians%27%20Recap%3a%20Tristan%20Thompson%20Talks%20Jordyn%20Woods%20Hookup" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./albert-brooks-parents-meet-harry-parke-thelma-leeds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Albert Brooks Parents: Meet Harry Parke &amp;amp; Thelma Leeds">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ted-washington-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ted Washington Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
